# Class Methods

This repo is to be used in conjunction with the Turing lesson on [Class Methods](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/lessons/class_methods).

## How to Use
Fork, then clone this repository.
Start with `warmup.rb`, and answer the questions in comments.

Then, open the `exercise_1` directory (`cd exercise_1`) and start with the `1runner.rb` file.
Tests for each exercise are provided for you, so that you can understand how class methods may be tested.


### Using Pry
`Pry` bindings have been left in comments, with some suggestions for guided questions. It is recommended that you un-comment each `binding.pry` with the question next to it in mind. Try to answer that question *first* before evaluating the code in question in your `pry` session.
